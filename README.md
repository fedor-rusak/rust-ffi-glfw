# Rust + FFI + GLFW

Want some fun with Rust and game dev? Well bad news everyone. Everything for rust is unix-oriented and the top gaming OS got short stick.

And I want to do simple example with GLFW using Rust bit by bit. So that it would work and could be compiled on you Windows PC for f%&$ sake!
